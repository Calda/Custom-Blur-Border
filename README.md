## Blurb

Blurb is an iOS app written in Swift that lets you add customizable blurred backgrounds to your photos. This was really useful for Instagram at the time, because they used to only support square images. It's been used over 100,000 times.

I prototyped Blurb in Swift 1.2 at WWDC 2015 and released it later that year in November.
